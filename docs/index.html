      <h3>A solid project starter</h3>

      <p class="sans">Setting up the framework for your project and creating new components should be quick and easy. By using our <a href="https://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator, you not only get access to a collection of <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a>, CSS, and JavaScript files, but also a modern front end build process.</p>

      <h3>Component based architecture</h3>
      <p class="sans">Capital Framework components can be used by themselves or easily compiled to work together. We rely on <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> to manage the downloading and updating of components and their dependencies within a project.</p>
